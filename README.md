# TIC-TAC

This is an interface to play the popular "TIC TAC TOE" game in person. The setup involves a camera and a 3*3 board, preferably a white board with black border, laid down on the floor. The camera is set up to capture the board. The players can step onto the board, into the boxes to mark their play.
